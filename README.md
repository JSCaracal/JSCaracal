Hello! Thank you for taking the time to click on this readme repo to read about me! 

My name is Joshua Sipos, and I'm currently a senior at UCF in the computer sciene program. On this github profile, you will be able to see all the projects I 
have worked on in the past. From class exercises, to personal projects, to repos I have contributed to. I am currently knowledgeable in C, Java, C++, and Python. 
When it comes to Web Development I have fluent understanding of HTML, and CSS with the aim to learn more about these languages along with learing JavaScript. 
With my career, I hope to work with logistical companies, or assist with the computer developmnent of rail networks across the country as I am a strong believer in
public transportation.

If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to my email: joshuasipos00@gmail.com
